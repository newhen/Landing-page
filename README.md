# Tower Hill Capital Partners - Landing Page

Static site intended for GitHub Pages.

## Quick deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `towerhillcapitalpartners.github.io` **or** any repo name you prefer.
2. Upload the files in this folder (index.html, styles.css, script.js, assets/).
3. In the repo:
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**.
   - Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`.
   - Choose the branch (e.g., `main`) and root (`/`), then **Save**.
4. Your site will publish at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>` (or at the root if you used the special repo name).

## Custom domain (optional)
- In **Settings → Pages**, add your custom domain. 
- Create a CNAME record at your DNS provider pointing to `<your-username>.github.io`.

## Local preview
